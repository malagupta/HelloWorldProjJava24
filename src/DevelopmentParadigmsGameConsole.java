/**
 * Often I read developers sharing their favorite 'Development Paradigms' in person or on the social
 * platforms - that are a fun take on the actual development paradigms. This game is inspired by those
 * interactions .
 * This is a console-based game that assigns humorous development paradigm styles based on user input.
 * Users enter letters A-Z to discover different development styles and their descriptions.
 * The game continues until the user enters '0' to quit.
